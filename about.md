Raymond Mao

- 15+ years of experience in embedded firmware development across Arm ecosystem, semiconductor vendors, and consumer device platforms.
- Worked in Linaro, implemented Arm SystemReady-related specifications (UEFI/TCG/TPM) across TF-A, OP-TEE, and U-Boot, turning architecture-level standards into production-quality firmware.
- Co-developed the Firmware Handoff specification and led its end-to-end implementation across BL2 (TF-A), BL31 (SPMD), BL32 (OP-TEE), and BL33 (U-Boot), establishing a unified mechanism for runtime parameter handoff across multiple boot stages on arm64 platforms.
- U-Boot custodian/maintainer for MbedTLS-port, with broader contributions across security and boot infrastructure, including crypto, bloblist, EFI loader, and TCG/TPM subsystems, covering feature development, integration, and upstream code review.
- Extensive experience contributing to and maintaining open-source firmware projects (TF-A, OP-TEE, U-Boot, Linux); Proficient in patch series preparation, RFC discussions, iterative code review, rebase/amend cycles, and subsystem ownership.
- Collaborated with engineers from Linaro member companies (Arm, AMD, Qualcomm, Socionext) on cross-company design alignment, upstream review, and resolution of complex cross-stage firmware integration issues.
- Early member of the Arm China joint venture secure firmware team; core developer of PSA-compliant (Platform Security Architecture) IoT security reference design and lead coordinator for PSA certification.
- Broadcom core firmware developer for DTV/set-top box platforms; co-author of the DCAS (Downloadable Conditional Access System) specification and lead contributor to both endpoint certification standards and product-level implementations.
- Strong domain experience across IoT/IoV, DTV, secure firmware, and security certification ecosystems; effective in working with silicon vendors, OEMs, and certification bodies.
- Multilingual: English, Mandarin, Japanese.
